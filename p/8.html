    <p>As you all probably already know (from <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html" shape="rect">here</a>), I am currently working on a project that needs me to collect data from various online resources. Since this data needs to be collected at regular intervals (due to updates happening to the data continuously), and not in just one go, I am using cronjob scripts to collect this data.</p><p>While writing this script I faced a lot of problems, and that is what I will discuss today. In the hope that someone out there will find something important from my mistakes and learnings, and that this post may be helpful in solving similar problems for him/her too.</p>

    <p>Hi there! Although I sincerely hope that you have been reading my recent git-week posts <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html" shape="rect">here</a>, <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-2-14.html" shape="rect">here</a>, <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-3-15.html" shape="rect">here</a>, <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-4-16.html" shape="rect">here</a> and <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-5-17.html" shape="rect">here</a>, frankly, I myself am happy that the week is over. No, no, don't misunderstand me. I am happy that I learned and was able to share these git gems with you all. But, I am currently undergoing some stress, due to</p><ul><li>things not going well at work (read <a href="http://www.golb.in/svn-unmerge-10.html" shape="rect">this</a> to know why)</li><li>I am starting to feel the pressure of "don't break the chain" (read about my attempt at it <a href="http://www.golb.in/dont-break-the-chain-12.html" shape="rect">here</a>)</li><li>Being a newbie to blogging, I am having some difficulty finding good ideas/matter to write about</li></ul>

    <p>Hello again. Welcome to the 5th post in the "git week" series; visit the previous 4 posts <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html" shape="rect">here</a>, <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-2-14.html" shape="rect">here</a>, <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-3-15.html" shape="rect">here</a> and <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-4-16.html" shape="rect">here</a>. Today I will share another extremely helpful git feature with you all: "git rebase -i".</p><p>If you remember, We have already used git-rebase once in the <a href="http://www.golb.in/svn-unmerge-10.html" shape="rect">svn unmerge</a> post. In that post I already showed how one could use git-rebase to easily handle things that are either too difficult or, at times, impossible to do in SVN. Today we will see an advanced use of git-rebase, that is "git rebase -i". This command allows us to reorder commits. Yes, you read that right! One can actually reorder commits in git. Ain't that cool?</p>

    <p>Hello again. Welcome back to the 4th post in the "git week" series; visit the previous 3 <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html" shape="rect">here</a>, <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-2-14.html" shape="rect">here</a> and <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-3-15.html" shape="rect">here</a>. Today I will share another extremely helpful git feature with you all: "git subtree".</p><p>But before i begin with the actual feature, let me give you the background story about how I came to discover it. I find it useful to explain something by first explaining the situation where I needed to use it. I hope that you find it helpful too :)</p>

    <p>Hi there. Welcome back to the 3rd post in the "git week" series; visit the previous 2 <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html" shape="rect">here</a> and <a href="http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-2-14.html" shape="rect">here</a>. Today I will share another extremely helpful git feature with you all: "git bisect".</p><p>I am sure you, like me, have faced situations when a feature, which you were sure was working previously, is found to have stopped working correctly. Obviously something changed in the recent past that broke this feature. If we have automated tests, one of which caught this breakage, then it should be pretty easy to fix. But what we are interested in, in this post, is not "how" to fix, but to understand "what" broke this feature, and "when". Maybe, if you are like my manager, you are also looking out for the "who", to put some blame on.</p>
