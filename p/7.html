    <p>Yesterday, I mentioned <a href="http://www.golb.in/kill-that-rat-28.html" shape="rect">here</a> about how I am using different tools and techniques to go mouseless and improve not only my productivity, but also the way I think. After writing it, I felt that each of those tools deserved a more detailed description than just a mention. This would also allow me to show you some of the cool things that I am able to do with them, and how I do them. Maybe they will act as a better motivating factor for you to make that switch :)</p><p>Today I will talk about <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/" shape="rect">stumpwm</a>, the best (according to me) of them all. As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Window_Manager" shape="rect">DWM</a> it is extremely minimal in terms of look-and-feel, but highly configurable. Since a picture is worth a 1000 words, I'll let the below screenshots do the talking of the look-and-feel of stumpwm:</p>

    <p>I have been using <a href="http://www.linux.org/" shape="rect">Linux</a> for atleast the last 9 years, trying out different distributions like <a href="http://www.redhat.com/" shape="rect">RedHat</a>, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" shape="rect">Fedora</a>, <a href="http://www.debian.org/" shape="rect">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" shape="rect">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/" shape="rect">Gentoo</a> and finally settling down on <a href="http://www.sabayon.org/" shape="rect">Sabayon</a> (for the last 2 years).

    <p>I had mentioned in one of my previous articles <a href="http://www.golb.in/more-exciting-new-features-for-golbin-25.html" shape="rect">here</a>, that we had changed our lazyloading technique for google-ads on <a href="http://www.golb.in/" shape="rect">Golbin!</a> pages. Today I will show you how we did it.</p><p>Previously, we were using the awesome jQuery lazyload Ad plugin as shown in their documentation <a href="http://jqueryad.web2ajax.fr/" shape="rect">here</a>. However, the plugin itself added about 8.4Kb to the page-weight. Even though Golbin! was using measures to lazyload the plugin itself, it was still additional page-weight, especially for first time (with browser cache empty) users.</p>

    <p>Since today was the last day of tour, we decided to go for the "<a href="http://busan.for91days.com/2012/07/06/the-eulsukdo-island-bird-sanctuary/" shape="rect">Eulsukdo eco-center</a>" themed tour that we had missed on the unfortunate 3rd day. So we got up early and went to Busan station. But it looks like the Eulsukdo tour was jinxed. When I called the Busan city tour help-desk (+82-51-464-9898), they told me that both the morning and afternoon tours were fully reserved. Anyways, we were already in the bus and went to Busan station hoping that someone might skip (like we had on our 3rd day). We reached the station just a few minutes before the departure only to find out that there was just 1 empty seat. Dejected, we tried to decide what to do next. We had 3 options:</p><ul><li>Visit Beomeosa (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beomeosa" shape="rect">[1</a>], <a href="http://koreantemples.com/?p%3D241" shape="rect">[2</a>], <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d615908-Reviews-Beomeosa_Temple-Busan.html" shape="rect">[3</a>]) temple by ourselves</li><li>Visit <a href="http://www.busanhaps.com/article/history-hills-busans-gamcheon-culture-village" shape="rect">Gamcheon</a><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d3901349-Reviews-Gamcheon_Culture_Village-Busan.html" shape="rect">culture</a> village by ourselves</li><li>Go back to hotel and come back for afternoon tour</li></ul>

    <p>Today I wasn't in a mood to travel all the way to Busan station (it's about 35-50 mins from Haeundae beach, depending on the traffic; also the Haeundae -> Busan (bus #1003) route is longer than the other way around). So we decided to do some local sightseeing, which included <a href="http://www.busanaquarium.com/en/" shape="rect">Busan aquarium</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsegae" shape="rect">Shinsegae</a> mall.</p><p>As I have mentioned <a href="http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-1-haeundae-beach-20.html" shape="rect">here</a>, I was super excited to visit the Busan aquarium because it offered the once in a lifetime opportunity to swim with the sharks. Unfortunately, my hopes were shattered because when I inquired about it, I was sent from one desk to another and then asked to call some phone number where the man only spoke Korean. I spent 30 mins running from desk-to-desk, by which time my wife was pissed off because my daughter being difficult to be managed by her alone. We also did not get to sit in the glass-bottomed boat because my daughter was too young. The actual fishes weren't that exciting since the variety was almost the same as what we had already seen in <a href="http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D736274" shape="rect">COEX mall aquarium</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul" shape="rect">Seoul</a>. I did manage to get 1 macro image that I liked a lot</p>
