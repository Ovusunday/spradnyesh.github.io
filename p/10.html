    <p>Anyone who has learnt basic "operating system" concepts in their Computer Science engineering knows about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer-consumer_problem" shape="rect">producer consumer problem</a>. It is a classic synchronization problem, where there are 2 processes, the "producer" and the "consumer", both sharing a fixed size common buffer. The producer produces something that is consumed by the consumer. The problem is to make sure that the producer does not try to add to an already full buffer and that the consumer does not try to remove from an empty buffer. But today I am not going to discuss this problem from a Computer Science perspective, but from a completely different angle.</p><p>I had mentioned in one of my previous articles, <a href="http://www.golb.in/dont-break-the-chain-12.html" shape="rect">here</a>, I am trying to write 1 new story every day, or atleast every weekday. Now you might ask what has that to do with the producer-consumer problem. Well, let me explain.</p>

    <p>Lately i have been having streaks of unproductive days. Days when i don't feel like doing anything. I think it's OK and normal to have a day or 2 like that, but when it becomes day"s", then one starts to worry. Work starts to pile up and frustration starts to build. Things go from normal to bad to worse. The mounting frustration does little to help getting out of this situation.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not lazy. Quite on the contrary, I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" shape="rect">GTD</a> fan. I use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/" shape="rect">emacs</a> and the super-excellent <a href="http://orgmode.org/" shape="rect">org-mode</a> to maintain both notes and tasks. In fact, org-mode was one big reason why i gave up my "Doc-vim" status and entered the life of emacs. Anyways, that's a story for a different day ;)</p>

        <h2>SVN unmerge</h2>

    <p>I recently came across the following scenario in my work-place. We use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" shape="rect">SVN</a> as our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" shape="rect">version control</a> repository, and use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(software" shape="rect">trunk</a>) for production pushes and feature branch for feature development. However, this time we made the mistake of merging feature-branch into trunk-prematurely; because the client team wanted to test both trunk features/bug-fixes and feature-branch changes together before the next launch (a very valid ask).</p><p>Now the issue is that if we get an critical bug that needs to be fixed ASAP, then the trunk is no longer clean to do a bug-fix and re-deploy.</p>

    <p>If you remember, we had mentioned in one of our recent posts that we increased the speed of our editorial site by 100 times. That's right, 100 times! So what is the secret? How did we do it? Well, actually there's the short answer and the long answer.</p><p>For all you impatient folks out there, the short answer first: We put extremely long processes (like sending email) into the background and returned the page without waiting for its result!</p>

        <h2>Exciting new features on Golbin!</h2>
        <div id="post-meta">

    <p>We have been absent from writing articles for some time now because we were working on improving the <a href="http://www.golb.in/" shape="rect">Golbin!</a> experience. For both viewers and story-tellers! So lets see what's new in <a href="http://www.golb.in/" shape="rect">Golbin!</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Load comments via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" shape="rect">ajax</a></strong>: This feature will load comments in a lazy fashion; that is, after the whole page has been loaded. Because of this, the page-load-time (as seen by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc) will improve and give <a href="http://www.golb.in/" shape="rect">Golbin!</a> a better <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" shape="rect">SEO</a> ranking.</li><li><strong>Threaded comments</strong>: Viewers can now reply to existing comments, or add fresh new comments of their own. We hope that this will increase viewer engagement. Not only via interaction within themselves, but even the story-teller will be able to respond to particular comments and have a meaningful, relevant and easy-to-follow conversation!</li><li><strong>Page backgrounds</strong>: Story-tellers can now define a custom image for all of their pages (story pages, and author page) and make their stories more beautiful and attractive for viewers. Also, this will help them distinguish themselves from other story-tellers, and portray their personality more effectively!</li><li><strong>Improved editorial site performance</strong>: Last, but not least, we made some performance improvements to the editorial site. This small change alone brought the page timings down from 3 seconds to 30 milliseconds, an improvement of <strong>100x!</strong></li></ul>
