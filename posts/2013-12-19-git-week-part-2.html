    <p>Hello again! Today we will see some more git magic. (Click <a href='http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html'>here</a> to see my previous post on git.)</p><p>This time we are going to learn about the "filter-branch" functionality which proved immensely helpful to me in 2 different scenarios, both unrelated, but both of which happened yesterday at different times of the day.</p><p>The 1st was that i use 2 different aliases for different projects. Unfortunately, in one recently started project, I used the default (wrong, in this project) user.name/user.email combination. Fortunately, I had not published it into any online repository (see my previous post as to why ;)). So I still had the opportunity to change this information. I knew that it could be done, but did not know how. So I learned it and will share it with you:</p><pre><code>git filter-branch --commit-filter 'GIT&#95;COMMITTER&#95;NAME=&quot;&lt;new-name&gt;&quot;; GIT&#95;AUTHOR&#95;NAME=&quot;&lt;new-name&gt;&quot;; GIT&#95;COMMITTER&#95;EMAIL=&quot;&lt;new-email&gt;&quot;; GIT&#95;AUTHOR&#95;EMAIL=&quot;&lt;new-email&gt;&quot;; git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;;' HEAD
</code></pre><p>Of course, your case might not be as simple. That is, unlike me, you might need to change based on some condition, or only change a few particular commits. You can find a good example <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/870367'>here</a>.</p><p>The second case where filter-branch turned out to be extremely life-saving was in the same recently started project. I have been scraping some info from the Internet and storing these (separate) files in the local repository. It was big data; largest that I have worked on personally, growing at a rate of about 23Mb everyday. Now it turned out that if I would concatenate the contents of these files into a single file then it would keep my directory structure more manageable and also better for the analysis tool that I would use.</p><p>But the problem was that I had already scraped data for 3 days (70Mb of data), and even if I removed the original files, they would still be in the history. This would mean that my repository would simple double the moment I moved to the new file format. The solution was to remove these files (I did not really need them in the history since I was still retaining the "data" in the new format) from history. This is where "filter-branch" feature of git came in handy again. The commands to achieve this are:</p><pre><code>git filter-branch --index-filter &quot;git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch $files&quot; HEAD
rm -rf .git/refs/original/ &amp;&amp; git reflog expire --all &amp;&amp;&amp;amp;nbsp; git gc --aggressive --prune&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre><p>Fortunately, even though I had hundreds of (small) files, I had created the filenames in the <date-in-yyyymmdd-format>-<source> format, so it was very easy for me to invoke the commands like so:</source></date-in-yyyymmdd-format></p><pre><code>git filter-branch --index-filter &quot;git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch &lt;yyyymm&gt;-&#42;&quot; HEAD
rm -rf .git/refs/original/ &amp;&amp; git reflog expire --all &amp;&amp;&amp;amp;nbsp; git gc --aggressive --prune&lt;/yyyymm&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre><p>The 2nd "rm -rf" command is needed to remove temporary files that git maintains for a long time even after asking it to clear everything.</p><p>With this technique, I was able to reduce the repository size (after adding the new format files) to about 60%, a good saving :)</p><p>Remember, both the above actions are destructive and may mess up your repository, so it's best to try them out on a clone first. Also, do NOT do them if you have already published your changes to prevent others from facing non-fast-forward pull errors.</p>
