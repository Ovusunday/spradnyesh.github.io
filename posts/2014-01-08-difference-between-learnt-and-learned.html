    <p>Hi there! Although I sincerely hope that you have been reading my recent git-week posts <a href='http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-1-13.html'>here</a>, <a href='http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-2-14.html'>here</a>, <a href='http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-3-15.html'>here</a>, <a href='http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-4-16.html'>here</a> and <a href='http://www.golb.in/git-week-part-5-17.html'>here</a>, frankly, I myself am happy that the week is over. No, no, don't misunderstand me. I am happy that I learned and was able to share these git gems with you all. But, I am currently undergoing some stress, due to</p><ul><li>things not going well at work (read <a href='http://www.golb.in/svn-unmerge-10.html'>this</a> to know why)</li><li>I am starting to feel the pressure of "don't break the chain" (read about my attempt at it <a href='http://www.golb.in/dont-break-the-chain-12.html'>here</a>)</li><li>Being a newbie to blogging, I am having some difficulty finding good ideas/matter to write about</li></ul><p>Anyways, I will do an honest attempt to not only not break the chain, but also to not give under-cooked material to read. Otherwise you might feel bored and go away. Now, we don't want that to happen, do we? But at the same time I will keep the topic for today light enough so that I am able to achieve my objectives</p><ul><li>provide useful/entertaining information to you</li><li>improve my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition'>cognitive</a> and writing skills</li><li>not break the chain</li></ul><p>So the topic for today is "difference between learnt and learned". Before I go on to the formal differences, let me tell you my version of the story. I used to think that "learnt" was something that had happened very very long time ago, like "I had learnt to ride a bicycle when I was 5 years old", whereas "learned" was something that happened very recently, or just now, like "I just learned what this means". Also, I noticed (when saying sentences containing the words in my mind) that I would lean towards using "learnt" almost always instead of using "learned".</p><p>Now I am not really sure if this is correct (along with the other definitions that I will show below) or not. What do you think? Probably you too thought similarly.</p><p>But 1 important question that I have not said anything about is "why". As in, "why" did i get interested in the difference between "learnt" and "learned" in the first place. Why does it matter to me at all? The story behind this is that when i was writing the post about <a href='http://www.golb.in/speed-your-website-100-times-11.html'>speed your website 100x times</a>, my editor showed the word "learnt" in yellow color grabbing my attention. I went into spell-check and the only option it showed was "learned"; "learnt" was not there at all in it's suggestions. This confused me because I knew for sure that "learnt" is a valid word. This piqued my curiosity enough for me to quickly search online for meanings and differences between the 2 words.</p><p>Anyways, coming back to the actual differences. Unexpectedly I found 2 <i>unrelated</i> differences <a href='http://www.tellmewhyfacts.com/2007/02/what-is-difference-between-learnt-and.html'>here</a> and <a href='http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-learned-and-learnt/'>here</a>. The first one says that they are the same words, but pronounced (and spelled) differently in British and American English. Well, that atleast explains</p><ul><li>why I would lean towards using "learnt" instead of using "learned" almost every time (since I am Indian and learn British English. Actually what Indians use is our very own dialect of English, if I may call it that. But lets be content by saying that since India was ruled by the British for more than 150 years, what we use is British English)</li><li>why my editor did not show "learnt" in its suggestions; because I am using the American (en-US) language pack for spelling check/correction</li></ul><p>The second definition <a href='http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-learned-and-learnt/'>here</a> mentioned "learned" as an adjective, like "he is a very learned man", whereas "learnt" as a verb, like "he has learnt many languages". Looking back, I remember having learnt something like this when I was in school. But I have never been very good with languages (and history and geography and ... (the list goes on, heh heh!)). But hey, I did manage to use the correct word in my previous sentence. Does that mean that I am a learned man now?</p><p>What do you think?</p>
